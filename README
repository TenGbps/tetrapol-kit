TETRAPOL radio processing kit.

For license see file COPYING.

The intention is to create scientific research tool for analysis of TETRAPOL
radio networks and its warious aspects.
The project is under constant development, there is no stable release.

With this tools You should be able:
  - find TETRAPOL radio channels and identify base stations
  - recieve TETRAPOL downlink transmissions
  - monitor traffic
  - receive text messages
  - TODO: detect and decode uplink transmission
  - TODO: decode received audio
  - TODO: detect and receive direct calls

Tools are in variou stage of development and usability, compoments marked
TODO are not implemented at all.

== Installation

You need various libraries, because this software is rapidly changing, no
list is provided here. You should be able to idetify it by you-self
(try and failure method).

Use the following magic sequence to build this project.

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

== Usage

  * edit ruh.sh as needed
  * connect SDR (RTL-SDR, BladeRF, HackRF or any other supported by osmo-sdr)
  * run the script

./run.sh

See file run.sh for example of tools usage. This script should give you basic
inspiration how to use individual tools. If you feel totaly lost you should
try harder or start playing with something simpler.
