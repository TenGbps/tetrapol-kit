TETRAPOL radio analysis kit.

For license see file COPYING.

The intention is to create scientific research tool for analysis of TETRAPOL
radio networks. The project is under constant development, there is no stable
release.

With this tools You should be able:
  - find TETRAPOL radio channels and identify base stations
  - recieve and demodulate all TETRAPOL transmissions
  - analyse traffice metadata
  - send crafted traffic

There is still lot of thinks TODO, see TODO for details.

== Installation
  Install libraries and development files for:
cmocka, glib2, json-c

Build:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

# optionaly if you want TX
cd ../demod
grcc tetrapol_tx.grc

== Available toos
  The package consist of those tools:

=== app/tetrapol_dump
  This decodes traffic from demodulated TETRAPOL channel.

=== demod/demod.py
  Demodulator. It allows receive and demodulate arbitrary number of TETRAPOL
channels.

=== demod/tetrapol_rx.py
  Another demodulator. It allows more efficient reception of multiple channels
at the same time, and some other tricks, but does not allow fine tunning for
each channel etc.

== demod/tetrapol_rx_cli.py
  Client commandline interface to tetrapol_rx.py.

=== demod/tetrapol_tx.grc
  GNURadio sketch for transmission of single TETRAPOL channel.

=== run.sh
  Helper script providing some user interface for tetrapol_rx.py
  * edit ruh.sh as needed
  * connect SDR (RTL-SDR, BladeRF, HackRF or any SDR supported by osmo-sdr)
  * run the script

== Usage
  Easiest way to start is with ./run.sh script. Edit and customize it before
first usage.

If you feel lost you should try harder or play with something simpler.
