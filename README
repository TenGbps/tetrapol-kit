Kit for analysing of TETRAPOL radio networks.

For license see COPYING.

The intention is to create scientific and research tool for analysis of
TETRAPOL radio networks. The project is under heavy (but slow) development,
there is no stable release yet.

With this tools You should be able:
  - find and identify base stations
  - receive and demodulate TETRAPOL transmissions
  - analyse traffic data
  - send crafted traffic

There is still lot of thinks TODO, see TODO for details.

== Installation
  Install libraries and development files for:
cmocka, glib2, json-c

Build:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

# optionaly if you want TX
cd ../demod
grcc tetrapol_tx.grc

== Usage
  Edit parameters in tetrapol_detector.sh and run it.

If you feel lost you should try harder or play with something simpler.

== Tools description

== app/tetrapol_build
  Build channel for transmission from input file with frames.

=== app/tetrapol_dump
  Decode traffic from demodulated TETRAPOL channel.

=== demod/demod.py
  Demodulator. It allows receive and demodulate arbitrary number of TETRAPOL
channels.

=== demod/tetrapol_tx.grc
  GNURadio sketch for transmission of single TETRAPOL channel.
