TETRAPOL Specification Part 16 Security, PAS 0001-16-1 (V1.0.3 RESTRICTED)
TETRAPOL Specifications; Part 16: Security; Part 1: Security services PAS 0001-16-1 Version: 2.1.0 Date: 30 January 1998. -- contains nothing, has been heavily redacted since 2.0.0, require version <= 1.0.2 (30 September 1996)
TETRAPOL Specifications; Part 16: Security; Part 2: KSW – KMC interface PAS 0001-16-2 Version: 2.1.0 Date: 30 January 1998. -- not really interesting, but may contain over-the-air rekeying and challenge-response high-level protocol description

== Cryptography description

Key used for encryption is probably 128 bit long and is composed from pieces.

Manual direct mode key have ~33 bit of initial entropy (9 decimal digits)
Other preprogramed kes have probably size: 2^48

Multiple keys are used, separate key for:
    * Direct Mode Key (DMK) - common for all stations
    * Personalisation Key (PK) - encrypt data available to all stations
    * Teminal Master Key (TMK) - authentication of station in network

After login into network, more keys is loaded into station:
    * Terminal Key of Key (TKK) - used for encryption/decryption of other keys
    * Other keys used for comunication encryption and signing

For Emergency Multi site Open Channel (EMOCH) is encryption disabled.
