= bit layout in voice frame



== LAR coefficients

Data in frame are stored as big endian, bellow is bit mapping to individual
parameters.

LAR_0: 0, 23, 22, 21, 20
LAR_1: 1, 27, 26, 25, 24
LAR_2: 2, 30, 29, 28
LAR_3: 3, 33, 32, 31
LAR_4: 4, 36, 35, 34
LAR_5: 39, 38, 37
LAR_6: 42, 41, 40
LAR_7: 45, 44, 43
LAR_8: 48, 47, 46
LAR_0: 51, 50, 49

== Other,

There are 3 groups of bits at possitions 5:9, 10:14, 15:19 and then 3 groups of
bits in range 52:120, namely 52:74, 75:96, 97:119.
