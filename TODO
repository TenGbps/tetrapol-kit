 * I/O interface for export of processed informations
 * JSON output for frame errors (Rx statistics, berr)
 * reimplement and improve error correction
 * receive uplink channel(s)
 * optimize code for speed a bit
 * support multiple signal sources at least for uplink and downlink
 * Improve demodulator and frame decoder
   * Current implementation causes frame coruption whenever single bit
     in input stream is broken!
   suggestions:
   * frame decoder should use soft decisions
   * output from demodulator should be something like:
     a) single floating point value <-1, 1> representing probabale state of
        radio signal, or
     b) two values, one with <-1, 1> representing probably demodulated value
        and second with "relative signal quality" or something
 * improve logging
 * implement audio codec
